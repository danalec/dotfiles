dotfiles
========
 
Misc configuration files from my $HOME directory ;) ...
 
This is my repository containing some configuration files that I use on my *nix
systems.
 
Why the README.md file is hidden? This is because this repo is supposed to be
clonned on $HOME directory directly, instead to clone to some folder and use
symlinks/shell voodoo to put the files on the correct place. This has some
advantages (it's easier to manage files, especially if you use Zsh+Git
integration like me), but this also means I can't put a README.md/LICENSE/etc
files on this repo or these files would appear on my $HOME directory. And well,
this is a dotfile repo, so it makes sense to README.md to be a dotfile too.
 
To install, simple clone this repository on your $HOME directory. After that,
you need to do a:

```
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive --remote
```

on your $HOME directory since I use git submodules to all plugins managers
(Vundle/Oh-My-Zsh/Package Control) and sometimes I use submodules of a
submodules because of a specific plugin (like zsh-syntax-highlighting). After
instalation you need to run 

```
  :PluginInstall
```

on Vim command mode to install all plugins. There is no need to do something
similar to Oh-My-Zsh or Package Control since they're self contained.
 
If you do like this repo I recommended you to fork and make your changes on
your own repository, since this is pretty personal configuration and I know
not everyone would like it.
