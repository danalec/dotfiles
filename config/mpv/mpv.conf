# Quality related settings #
############################

# Before starting, it is important to understand how some settings influence the video 
# quality/performance.
# The most important one is scale and its derivatives (dscale, cscale, tscale).
# Better scalling algorithms result in better images when the video is reproduced in non-native
# resolution, at the expense of performance. However unless you're nitpicking this shouldn't be a
# problem when watching videos. For scale/dscale/cscale, the best algorithms are ewa_lanczos*, but
# they're very slow (needs a high end GPU, specially for downscalling high-resolution videos).
# spline36 is generally good enough (and the default in vo=opengl-hq), while bilinear is the
# default and very fast (but low quality).
#
# tscale is a completely different thing, used only if the option _interpolation_ is active.
# interpolation reduces stuttering caused by mismatches in video FPS and display rate (the majority
# of displays are 60Hz, while videos may have 24Hz or 25Hz and you can't divide cleanly with 60/24
# or 60/25). While it does reduce stuttering, it introduces blur too, so you may deactivate it if
# you don't like.
# There are various algorithms that works well in tscale: oversample, mitchell (default), robidoux
# (and its variation robidouxsharp), gaussian, triangle, catmull_rom, etc. You can get the full list
# by using:
# $ mpv -vo=opengl:tscale=help
# in command line.

# Mimics opengl-vhq, but change some settings.
# More details here: https://github.com/haasn/mpvhq/blob/master/DOCS/man/vo.rst
# Very high/slow quality settings, needs high end GPU and good drivers.
# You may reduce prescale-passes to increase performance at the expense of quality, defaults to 1
# and goes up to 5. Another option is to change the number of nnedi3-neurons, from 16 up to 128.

# Much faster and slightly lower quality variation from above, seems to work with recent Intel GPUs.
# You may set prescale-downscaling-threshold to any value between 1.0 to 1.5 to reduce quality
# and improve performance on HD videos. Lower values are faster/lower quality.

# No color correction, better performance and no quality drop (except maybe wrong colors).
# vo=opengl-hq:interpolation:tscale=mitchell:tscale-clamp:temporal-dither:prescale=superxbr:prescale-downscaling-threshold=1.5:blend-subtitles=yes

# Finally, fastest settings still including interpolation.
# vo=opengl:interpolation:tscale=mitchell:tscale-clamp:blend-subtitles=yes

# In some setups (non-X11, multi-monitor, etc.) display refresh auto-detection is broken.
# Check "Framerate: V=<ignore>/D=<number>" in command line. If the number is "infinite" or simple
# wrong, put the right value below.
# display-fps=60

# Needed for interpolation option above.
